In this problem I represent the relationship between groups as a Tree. This allowed me to check every group using a BFS algorithm by tree levels.

Time complexity: The time complexity of this algorithms will be O(N) N being = max(number of user in a group) + number of groups
Space complexity: The space complecity of this alogirhtm will be O(N) where N number of users + number of groups
