From this problem I used recursion. As the base case I used the assertion -> 'entry is a file" -> end recusion, 
and added the path to the path list if the extension matched the argument. If the current iteraction was a directory I recursevlly 
called the function with the directory as the base directory for the search. 

Time complexity: O(N) -> Where N is the number of files + directories on the search space
Space complexity: O(M) -> where M is the number of files that match the extension and are added to the list
