For this problem I used each node of the trie as a character. On the insertion step as I trasversed the trie until 1 of 2 cases happened

1. Finished searching for the word and all the nodes were present on the trie.
2. There were no more nodes, so I started adding a node for each remaining character

Both of this cases (Insertion operation) would be O(n) -> n being the length of the longest word being added

For the suffix section I did the following algorithms:
1. Traverse the trie until the last letters of the prefix was found on the trie
2. When reaching the trie node from the last character of the prefix I performed a DFS. This allowed me to print each word by tacking in count any inner word too -> Example add[ition] -> print "add" and "addition"
-> The suffix function takes runtime complexity of O(N). -> N being the number of suffix on the trie form the prefix nodes on the trie

Space complexity: O(N) -> N being the number of distint characters aded to the trie
