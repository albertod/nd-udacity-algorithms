We did this problem already in one of the videos of algorithms sorting. In this case our domain consist of 3 integers 0,1,2. We know if we sort
0's and 2's we would also sorth the 1's. So I decided to keep 2 cursors one at the begining of the array for tracking the next postion of the 
new found 0's and one at the end of the array to keep track on where to place the next "2" found. The runtime of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity O(1)
